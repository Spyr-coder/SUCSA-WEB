    <!-- Past Event: World Environment Day -->
    <h3>Past Event: World Environment Day 2025 ‚Äì Tree Planting</h3>
    <p>
      On <strong>5th June 2025</strong>, members of the Seme University and College Students Association (SUCSA) joined the global community in celebrating <strong>World Environment Day 2025</strong> under the theme <em>‚ÄúEnding Plastic Pollution.‚Äù</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      In partnership with the administration and Scouts of <strong>Seme Technical and Vocational College</strong>, we planted trees as a symbol of our commitment to a greener, more sustainable future. This act of unity not only celebrated the day but also sparked critical conversations on how afforestation can reduce the impact of plastic pollution.
    </p>
    <p>
      We emphasized alternative ways to reuse plastics instead of disposing of them irresponsibly. Nature-based solutions, such as afforestation, are vital to rebuilding ecosystems and reducing synthetic waste. We thank all who took part in this impactful initiative.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let us continue the mission to educate, act, and lead every day‚Äînot just on World Environment Day!
    </p>
